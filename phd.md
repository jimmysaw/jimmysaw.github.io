## PhD student position

The Saw lab is currently looking for highly motivated individuals for PhD studies in biological sciences at the George Washington University. The student will lead projects to characterize microbes living in extreme habitats using both cultivation and omics (metagenomics, single-cell genomics, etc). We are especially interested in archaeal and bacterial diversity and evolution in extreme environments. The position will involve field trips to collect samples, microbiological (cultivation/microscopy/experimental), and computational (omics) components. Students with a background in microbiology, experience in culturing microbes (especially extremophiles) and microscopy, and/or knowledge of programming languages (such as R and Python) will be highly competitive for the position.

Appointment of the position is contingent upon acceptance into the George Washington University PhD program in biological sciences. GWU graduate program application deadline is 1st of December. The Department of Biological Sciences provides highly competitive support for successful candidates to the PhD program. Applicants who are interested in joining the Saw lab should email Dr. Saw [jimmysaw AT gmail DOT com] a copy of their recent curriculum vitae, a brief description of research interests and motivation for joining the research group, and names and contact information of two references. Applicants are expected to hold a BS and/or MS degree in microbiology or related disciplines at the time of appointment. Please contact Dr. Saw in advance of your intended application.
