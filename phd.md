## Open positions

### PhD student position

The Saw lab is currently looking for highly motivated PhD students with a background in microbiology to lead projects to cultivate previously uncultivated microbes from various habitats. The project will initially focus on cultivation and genomics of deep-branching cyanobacteria that might hold clues to the origin and evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis. This position will involve field trips to collect samples, microbiological (cultivation/experimental), and computational (genomics/metagenomics) components.

Students with the following skill sets will be highly competitive for the position:

- Experience in culturing microbes (especially cyanobacteria)
- Basic techniques in microbiology (aseptic techniques, familiarity with BSL, etc)
- Experience in microscopy (epifluorescence, confocal, electron microscopy, etc)
- Molecular biological techniques (PCR, cloning, library preparation, etc)
- Field experience and willingness to travel to collect samples
- Familiarity with basic bioinformatic analyses
- Knowledge of programming languages (eg: R, Python, etc) is highly advantageous

Appointment of the position is contingent upon acceptance into the George Washington University PhD program in biological sciences. GWU graduate program application deadline is 1st of December. The Department of Biological Sciences provides highly competitive support for successful candidates to the PhD program.
