## PhD student position

A doctoral student position is available in the lab of Dr. Jimmy Saw at the George Washington University (GWU) in Washington, DC. We are currently looking for highly motivated students who are interested in microbial diversity and evolution to join the research group in Fall of 2019. The student will be able to develop independent research projects of interest in line with those of the lab. We are interested in microbial diversity and evolution in extreme habitats (such as hot springs and hydrothermal vents) but also habitats around that world that are least explored.

We will use 'omics (metagenomics, single-cell genomics, etc), cultivation, microscopy, and laboratory experiments to understand microbial diversity, ecology, and evolution. Focus will be mostly placed on bacterial and archaeal diversity and evolution in extreme habitats. Field trips to collect samples from places such as hot springs and other habitats of interest will be required. Students with background in microbiology, experience in culturing microbes (especially extremophiles) and microscopy, field experience, and/or knowledge of programming languages (such as R and Python) will be highly competitive for this position.

Students who are interested in joining the group should email Dr. Jimmy Saw (at jimmysaw@gmail.com) a copy of their recent CV, a brief description of research interests, experiences, and motivation for joining the research group prior to applying to the PhD program. Please include GPA and GRE scores in your CV. While the GPA and GRE scores are factors in the admission process, previous experience, motivation, and passion for research are highly valued. The application deadline for Fall 2019 admissions is December 1st, 2018. The Department of Biological Sciences at GWU provides highly competitive support for successful candidates to the PhD program.

GWU is located in the heart of Washington, DC with close proximity to museums, research institutions, and many other places of interest.
