## Open positions

### PhD student position

I am currently looking for a highly motivated PhD student with background in microbiology to lead a project to cultivate previously uncultivated microbes from various habitats. The project will initially focus on cultivation and genomics of deep-branching cyanobacteria that might hold clues to the origin and evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis. This position will involve field trips to collect samples, microbiological (cultivation/experimental), and computational (genomics/metagenomics) components.

I am looking for candidates with the following skill sets:

**Essential skills:**
- Experience in culturing microbes
- Experience in microscopy (epifluorescence, confocal, electron microscopy, etc)
- Molecular biological techniques (PCR, cloning, library preparation, etc)
- Field experience and willingness to travel to collect samples
- Familiarity with basic bioinformatics analyses

**Additional skills:**
- Experience in working with cyanobacteria
- Knowledge of programming languages (eg: R, Python, etc) is highly advantageous

Appointment of the position is contingent upon acceptance into the George Washington University PhD program in biological sciences. GWU graduate program application deadline is 1st of December but it would be advantageous for you to contact me as soon as possible to discuss potential projects for the PhD. The department of biological sciences provides highly competitive support for successful candidates to the PhD program (two years of support for teaching assistantship and 3 years of research assistantship and tuition support).

Applicants who are interested in joining my lab should email me [jimmysaw AT gmail DOT com] a copy of their recent curriculum vitae, a cover letter indicating their research interests, previous research, and motivation to work with me, and if possible, names and contact information for two references. Applicants are expected to hold a BS or MS degree in microbiology or related disciplines at the time of the appointment.
