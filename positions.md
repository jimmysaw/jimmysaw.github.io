## Open positions

I am currently looking for a PhD student with background in microbiology to join my lab. 

GWU graduate program application deadline is in December 2018 but it would be advantageous for you to start applying to the program now and get in touch with me to discuss potential projects for the PhD.

The program supports 5 years of guaranteed support (2 years of TAship and 3 years of research fellowship) and is highly competitive.
