## Diversity and evolution of early oxygenic phototrophs

We are interested in diversity, ecology, and evolution of early oxygenic phototrophs and currently working towards acquiring them from various habitats.
Some of the lineages we are especially interested in are those that may have evolved the ability to produce oxygen gas as a byproduct of photosynthesis.
The lineages we are currently targetting include *Gloeobacter* species and closely related cyanobacteria. 

We are also interested in non-photosynthetic cyanobacterial lineages from various locations. A picture below shows a phototrophic biofilm dominated by rare cyanobacterial species known as *Gloeobacter*, which was found near steam vents of Hawaii.
