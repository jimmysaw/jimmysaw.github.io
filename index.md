## Welcome to the Saw Lab at the George Washington University!

We are interested in diversity, ecology, and evolution of microbes in extreme habitats such as hot springs and hydrothermal vents and also habitats that are least explored/studied. 
Diversity, Ecology, and Evolution are interconnected and intricately tied together. 
Evolution brings about diversity, diversity in turn dictates the ecology, and ecology brings about further evolution.
