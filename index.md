## Welcome to the Saw Microbial Diversity Lab at the George Washington University!

<img src="images/cave1.png">

We are interested in diversity, ecology, and evolution of microbes in extreme habitats such as hot springs, hydrothermal vents, caves, and also habitats that are least explored/studied.
Diversity, Ecology, and Evolution are intricately tied together in biology and we are interested in how these are influencing each other in microbial communities and how co-evolution of microbes take place.

Specifically, we aim to:
- understand how unique assemblage of microorganisms arise in extreme habitats
- explore functional diversity of microbial community in extreme habitats and evolutionary processes driving their diversity
- investigate evolutionary significances of major microbial groups
- cultivate previously uncultivated archaea and bacteria from various habitats
