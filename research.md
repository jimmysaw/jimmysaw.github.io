We are interested in diversity, ecology, and evolution of microbes in extreme habitats. 
These three overarching themes are interconnected and intricately tied together.
Evolution brings about diversity, diversity in turn dictates the ecology, and ecology brings about further evolution.

## Ongoing research projects

### SAR202

### Functional diversity in hot springs

### Diversity of early oxygenic *Cyanobacteria*

### Cultivation of archaea from hot springs
