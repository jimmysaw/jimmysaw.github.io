### SAR202

I am currently working on SAR202 diversity and evolution. Some stats on SAR202 abundances from TARA Oceans metagenomes.

### SAR11

I am also studying diversity of hypervariable regions (HVRs) in SAR11 bacteria using hybrid sequencing technologies (using both Illumina and Oxford Nanopore technologies).

### Archaeal diversity and origin of eukaryotes

I worked in the lab of Thijs Ettema in Uppsala Sweden from 2012 to 2016 to uncover archaeal diversity using cultivation-independent approaches (such as single-cell genomics and metagenomics).
We discovered novel archaeal phyla (the Lokiarchaeota), and subsequently the Asgard superphylum (consisting of Loki-, Thor-, Odin-, and Heimdall-archaeota).

We also discovered a novel class of archaea from Euryarchaeota, now named as Hadesarchaeota.
