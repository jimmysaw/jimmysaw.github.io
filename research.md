### SAR202

I am currently working on SAR202 diversity and evolution. Some stats on SAR202 abundances from TARA Oceans metagenomes.

### SAR11

I am also studying diversity of hypervariable regions (HVRs) in SAR11 bacteria using hybrid sequencing technologies (using both Illumina and Oxford Nanopore technologies).

### Archaeal diversity and the origin of eukaryotes

I worked in the lab of Thijs Ettema in Uppsala University in Sweden from 2012 to 2016 to uncover the archaeal diversity using cultivation-independent approaches (such as single-cell genomics and metagenomics).
We discovered a novel archaeal phylum (the Lokiarchaeota<sup>1</sup>), and subsequently the Asgard superphylum<sup>2</sup> (consisting of Loki-, Thor-, Odin-, and Heimdall-archaeota).

We also sequenced the draft genomes of a novel class of archaea from Euryarchaeota, now known as Hadesarchaeota<sup>3</sup>.

### Cultivation and complete genome sequencing of *Gloeobacter kilaueensis* JS1

I isolated and cultivated a very interesting cyanobacterium belonging to the genus *Gloeobacter* from the entrance of a volcanic cave in Kilauea caldera on the Big Island.
This cyanobacterium lacks thylakoid membranes usually present in cyanobacteria and plastids and is thought to be one of the earliest cyanobacteria to have evolved the ability to perform oxygenic photosynthesis.
The complete genome of this cyanobacterium was described in 2012<sup>4</sup>.
